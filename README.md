# HTML Template

This is a simple HTML template that I use to start my projects. It includes a basic folder structure with some default styles. It also uses laravel mix to compile the assets and copy them to the dist folder.

## Development

1. Run `npm install` and `npm run dev or watch` to make changes.
2. Run `npm run production` to remove dev files, minify assets and copy required files to the dist folder.
